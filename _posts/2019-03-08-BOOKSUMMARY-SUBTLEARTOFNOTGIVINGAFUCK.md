I honestly don't know how to write a book summary. I Googled it, read a bit about it, saw some examples and was completely unsatisfied with what I found. I thought about doing a book review as well but unfortunately I am not famous enough for that. A synopsis also felt a bit lacking as to what I wanted to achieve by thinking about writing a summary of this book in the first place. So I have decided I would do neither, I'll just present my thoughts on this book, give a brief what the book is about, tell you what it's not about, try to explain some concepts which I feel might get misinterpreted by mass populus who has read this book, touch upon the fact as to why this book is so famous and try to be as honest about all of this as much as possible

sounds too much right? does'nt as well go with the general idea of book summary as well even though the title said _"book summary"_ .

well I don't give a fuck.  

about atleast of what you think.

I have been thinking of doing book summaries for quiet sometime now. I like to read and it so happens most of the time I have difficulty keeping a track as to what I have read . But more importantly I wanted to keep a track of what I have _learned_ from a particular book. I have been putting off this idea for years now and I have finally decided to give it a shot. It's funny how the book which I chose in one of the chapters talks about this exact thing , _giving it a shot_ 'it' being whatever interests you. There is nothing new which has been told in this book that has not been said before about personal growth, prosperity, values and bias for action. Whether you are a noivce who has just picked up reading or decided to spent some time with themselves now or a self-help junkie deriving-high-from-books/seminars-of-self-help-authors chances are there might not be much revelations you will uncover while reading this book. And somewhere Mark Manson also realized this, so he made the book a bit funny, very straight forward and actually gave some practical advice as to how you can go about not giving a fuck.
the book is aptly subtitled as _'a counter intuitive approach to living a good life'_ because if you are someone who is not belonging to the self-help diaspora then most of the concepts can look counter intuitive to you. Because our intuition sucks. It's not just the author who says it, it is something even I believe in. If I have to really formally do the _book summary part_ of this book book then I might as well just get over with it right now:
