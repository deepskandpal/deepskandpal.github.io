"So you are okay for taking the whole blame for this, " "yes sir it was completely my fault" , "okay so as a punishment you are suspended for a month without pay, I have got to say Naveen I am really disappointed" Mr Sharma gets up from his seat , shuffling all the papers which he holds in the right order of priority for his next task, he slowly walks out of the conference room. As Soon as the door closes shut behind him Alizyeh jumped up from the seat. "I know what you are going to say?" "you have no fucking clue about what I am going to say just like you have no fucking clue to as to what you just did." "It's not a big deal", "Not a big deal,You basically handed your ass on a fresh plate to that asshole for that bitch's blame" ,"did I ever tell you your swearing bothers me ?", "almost every day and every day I tell you to give a fuck about something more Important than my swearing ,Like your spine, Subtlelty of not giving a fuck is something you need to learn","first of all I wouldn't have bought that book for you if I knew you would use it against me all the time and secondly its not a big deal because its actually my fault right person is getting punished for the right reasons aren't you the one who keeps saying taking ownership of your own mistake is only thing that person should have" , "you stop using my philosophies against me and I'll stop using that book against you, and BTW you don't know or are you just pretending but you got played , you are tricked into believing it is your fault" "THE Add was my idea" ,"no Naveen the ADD was that bitch's idea she just pitched it to you and made you the point man for it she knew it was offensive she just wants you out can't you see that dummy." "forget about its not that bad most people get fired for this kind of mistake Sharma sir is being kind for just suspending me for a month." "he is not being kind he is saving his ass , deep down even he knows that if a proper investigation is carried out that bitch will be found to be responsible for all this and he doesn't want that to happen , otherwise she wouldn't let him in the bed next time","shut up alizyeh Mr Sharma is married!!" "not to her in case you have forgotten there is already a lovely Mrs Sharma who is super nice and I don't want her hurt because of some office cunt who is just using her ass to get ahead , and coming back to the topic if he would have fired his A-star creative director for being Creative the Apex would have had his ass so it looks like he is saving you but he is saving himself , his position, his reputation and his mistress and you sir you are the goat who is going to be this companies dinner" saying this alizyeh walks out, confused naveen shouts behind her "WHAT.. WHAT DOES THAT SUPPOSE TO EVEN MEAN?."

sitting in the room naveen thought _was she right?_ did he really fucked up his career for that bitch roshi ? "OH SHIT" said naveen in a very loud voice, _fuck I called her a bitch not nice_ he thought. 

"you are not nice you are naive there is a difference" alizyeh now nibbling her plain toast, just like any other office canteen this canteen was also generic, nothing was special about it. "and what i feel is you should...ahem" chocking on the toast alizyeh coughed, "what the.." naveen passes a glass of water to her ,he gets up and rubs her back while she inhales the water with more coughing. "I guess this your signal to shut up", "fuck off" ,"If I do then who will take all that gyaan from you" naveen went back to his seat "you don't need gyaan you already have it otherwise you wouldn't have been my boss despite being 4 years younger than me." she now started eating the omlette which was clearly meant to be eaten along with the toast _gosh why does she always eat the toast first?_
a pointless thought, he thought, but it always crosses his mind whenever they go out for lunch together _am I in love with her?_ _nah she is too old_ _so what?_ _nothing its not right we work together_ _well thanks to roshi you won't from tomorrow_ _its office she is my subordinate_ _so_ _she cares about you_ _like a little brother_ _how do you know?_ _well otherwise we would have started dating by now_ _for that to happen did you ask her out_ _she is my subordinate this is office_ and the vicious thought cycle which happens day everyday in naveen's head continued. _Oh I almost forgot_ "oh I almost forgot" "what?" "here" he pulls out an envelope and keeps it on the now empty toast plate filled with crums alizyeh picks up the envelope, brushing of the scrums she opens it and starts reading. "No way!! how could even make it possible" she just jumps from the other side of the table and hugs naveen "no wait, stop .. the plates" naveen struggles. she plants a big kiss on his cheek and looks in his eyes for a brief moment there is silence. "sir we will have to clean the broken glass sir please sir can you move sir" , the waiter appeared out of now where. "yeah please do and bhaiya aap yeh kuch paise.." taking some money out of his wallet "rakh lijiye iski bhar pai ke liye","iski koi zarurat nhi hai sir yeh office canteen hai " alizyeh and naveen looked at each other now since they were back to their seats a smile appeared on hearing that they don't have to compensate."aap dono ke bonus se kaat lenge hum"."motherfuck.." "relax there is no point"







Driving is something naveen is really fond of his choice of music mostly consists of songs where either vocals or a guitar is a prime vocus. One of his bad habbits was to give lifts to strangers, he was about to learn that being nice in this world comes with a price.
