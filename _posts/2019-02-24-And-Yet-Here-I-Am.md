intially jogging with each passing message ping  his phone was emanating ved incresed his pace. the message's frequecy increase was quiet evident. _waiting for an auto will be a waste of time_ he thought now in full fledge sprint. _5Km run at 13 kmph_ he calculated _yup doable_ he thought while systematically managing his breathe to match the rythm of his sprint.
