title: What Why and How
---

This is blog/scratch pad for the ideas that come to my mind. Being an Engineer I have the love of analysing things and Solving A problem. Being An Indian Engineer I Often know we don't do it and how badly do we need it.

Each week there will be a question which I would put out and try to answer. Some will be technical others can be philosophical but mostly about how and why we achieve or don't achieve greatness. 

I know it's a lofty statement and it may seem very stressfull to think about all this but what I'll try to do is to make these deep questions fun and interesting to answer.

My writing is new so some articles will be all over the place some may not make any sense but like I said in the first line it is also a scratch pad.

And Scratch Pads are meant to be messy
