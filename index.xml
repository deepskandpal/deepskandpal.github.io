      <description>Animal is a 2023 action film. The movie if I have to review is a good one time watch with solid performances by the cast and some amazing action performances. But the interesting thing was the discourse around the film. A lot of people where having mixed reactions to the film&amp;rsquo;s messaging and certain scenes were getting questioned. There is not much I would like to go into but the amount of content getting produced over the this discourse was interesting and I thought, Since I am a ML engineer and a Movies fan.</description>
