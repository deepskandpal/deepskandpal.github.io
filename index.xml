    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been what most people call &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t know what nice guy means, congratulations you are one . Before Feb 2022 I would avoid any and all kinds of conflict. A difficult conversation regarding something as simple as getting money back from a friend used to sound terrifying (so many times I have just reluctantly forgiven the debt). Talking to service staff for anything I need also felt like a task (excuse me waiter can i get my supposedly hot food reheated. No. cool thanks I&rsquo;ll just consume this partly cold dish which I am going to pay full prize for quielty) (Will this cab which is supposed to go to any place I want if I am paying full prize for the ride PLEASE take me. No. Cool I will just walk next 12 KM thanks), You get the idea. The truth is I hated that life and at the end of 2021 I decided I would change it. I didn&rsquo;t know what all problems I had back then so I did what I do the best when I am not sure of something.</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>Instead of partying like there is no tomorrow (which, when I do it, sometimes have almost lead to there being literally no tomorrow for me i.e almost dead). When I woke up it was a new day in 2022. 2022 fuck where are those flying cars I was promised back when I was kid? No flying cars just me overweight, unhappy, frustrated. But since I had a great sleep I woke with an elegant never-thought-of simple solution.</p>
<p>New year resolutions (hahaha, lol)</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with new year resolutions, its the stupid hype around them and the unnecessary criticism if one does not stick to them. If you read James clear&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atomic habits&rdquo; you would realise the importance of Habits. New year resolutions are the best way to make new habits. So like a dumb fucker I made a list of things I would fix this year</p>
<ol>
<li>Change city (since I was living with my parents, not very sad, just a little bit)</li>
<li>Change Job (I was making comfortable money, But I am an ambitious greedy fucker and I wanted to make butt load of money doing what I already love)</li>
<li>Lose weight (We will cover that a bit later)</li>
<li>Cook (looks quite small compared to the rest of list but it wasn&rsquo;t. Again more on it later)</li>
<li>DATE (I am hetrosexual male, Me want women. This one would be interesting I promise)</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was I should have Done 1 2 and 3 by first half of 2022 (6 months) and I should have set processes for good habits (remember Clear from above) for 4 and 5 by the end of year.</p>
<p>I have accomplised 1 and 2. For 3 my goal was wrong. I found 4 to be super easy. It is the 5th which turned out to be the most interesting and probably more difficult than I anticpated. Not the way you think, No I am not some lonely nerd who cannot keep a 2 sentence conversation with a random women. I am just a overconfident, arrogant nerd who cannot keep a women around for more than few months.Women have pined for me in the past (self-brag) and I have thought I don&rsquo;t deserve them or the happiness that comes with a relationship. It was difficult because it looked like a surface level &ldquo;Game&rdquo; problem but it turned out to be a deeper psychological one. Again my goal with 5th was wrong</p>
<p>So what does it have to do with controversy? or rather being controversial?</p>
<p>One of the &ldquo;dating play book I read&rdquo; (yes I did buy a 30$ dating play book. Make it 2) talked about how women like &ldquo;controversial men&rdquo;. This was way back during the inital days of my self-discovery journey (I am on it for last 6 months and will probably be on it for the rest of my life). But like everything else in my life that has happened. I set out to find something but I ended up finding something else.</p>
<p>You see. What the &ldquo;author&rdquo; was trying to communicate when he gave that bullshit advice was women like men who have &ldquo;controversial opinion&rdquo; over men who don&rsquo;t have any &ldquo;controversial opinion&rdquo; (nice guy remember ? you are one of them). It makes you more &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;. HENCE YOU SHOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL WITH WOMEN.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all bullshit. But it got me thinking and my weird brain started making connections everywhere with this &ldquo;controversial men are sexy&rdquo;. Why was he (Author)claiming this if it sound bullshit to me? (good thought exercise. Next time. When you hear a point from someone which you think sounds bullshit try to ask yourself.Why is this person making this bullshit point?).You see what he &ldquo;Really&rdquo; should have said was women like men who don&rsquo;t always AGREE with everything and have their mind of their own. If there is something they find unaccpetable the just say it no matter how &ldquo;Ignorant&rdquo; or &ldquo;Controversial&rdquo; it might be. It does not mean you should have an unpopular opnion just for the sake of it. THAT WAS WHAT THAT FUCKER WAS IMPLYING.FAKE YOUR UNPOPULAR OPINION TO GET LAID.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I will make a lot of points and opinions linked to this topic of women and dating, because currently this intrigues me, If you don&rsquo;t like it let me suggest something that will save both our time. STOP READING my blog)</p>
<p>So why does this all matter? What is the point? There is no point. Not everything has a summary or a moral. Somethings are just there. The truth is people don&rsquo;t become honest or express their honesty because they are afraid to be mistook or misinterpreted. The world does not reward for honesty it prefers or rewards lying. That is the whole basis of today&rsquo;s politics. The one who can lie convincingly. Sales also involves a good deal of lying. So why shouldn&rsquo;t you trying to fuck some chick be devoid of any truth?</p>
<p>This is basis of being a nice guy/conflict avoider/people pleaser (pick the term you are more comfortable with, they are all the fucking same). But what I am trying to say is the implication of you or anyone trying to hold back their true feelings or thoughts and not giving it voice goes beyond you screwing a chick. We do it even in places where there is no sexual expectation. We do it with friends, families, colleagues, bosses, online. We are scared of someone twisting our words and make us look like assholes. I was and to some extend still am a &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo;. Simply because I don&rsquo;t want unnecessary trouble. Which to some extend might look fine. But isn&rsquo;t that too much fuck to give about others opinion? Isn&rsquo;t the whole Mark Manson philosophy based on the idea of &ldquo;Not giving a fuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rareity of an open minded unfiltered asshole man is such that when one does come across one, other men (&ldquo;unframed men&rdquo;) start throwing respect at him and women their underwear. What I have understood after some soul searching is, its next to impossible to not have a controversial opinion about anything. We are all human and we do disagree with something in the world, We all DO have a problem with something in our surrounding. We just hold back. You don&rsquo;t have to be controversial . YOU ALREADY ARE CONTROVERSIAL. You just keep lying to yourself like a little bitch that you are not.</p>
<p>So now the zillion dollar question What the hell is poltically correct?</p>
<p>Today the world wants you to lie. Lie about who you are, lie about what you think, lie about what you feel. They want you to confirm to society. Which you would have to at least till the point you escape it (By being rich, it&rsquo;s that simple). If you stand out or don&rsquo;t confirm to the politics of the surrounding (Right or Left) and if you are a nobody.You are fucked. This is when people become politically correct.</p>
<p>Should you become one? I don&rsquo;t know, I am not a self-help guru, twitter is filled with them. With a few days of research you can find really good ones. They will tell you whats right and wrong.</p>
<p>I will just say what I have done or understood.</p>
<p>My life became much more easier by balancing between lying and being honest.</p>
<p>(More on that later)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Brain Dump</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am sorry if you landed here. It&rsquo;s not my fault though but still I will apologise. You are going to waste your time here. If you are smart you have already left but if you are dumb like me then let me Introduce you.. to the 4 weird russian texts just below the header (It came with the theme don&rsquo;t know how to fix it will probably in the future). If you made it this far then you are truly lonely but it also shows you have great patience for &ldquo;reader payoff&rdquo;. That being the case I would recommend reading lord of the rings It&rsquo;s insanely long but has a lot of readers payoff suprisingly at the exact moments where it starts to lose you (Tolkien is a genius). But if you are still reading (hats off). Let me tell you the purpose of this &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s just a journal for the mental thoughts I have every now and then. Why couldn&rsquo;t I get a notebook and &ldquo;jorunal&rdquo; like those Twitter self-help &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; because I believe in the idea of sharing thoughts. Quite normal right? No I don&rsquo;t mean polished final products like a fucking novel(yes baby swears will also be here). I meant unfiltered, unedited genuiune gut feelings with no polish what so ever combined with lets say some &ldquo;rational thinking&rdquo; and a few &ldquo;facts&rdquo;(hard to get any facts these days).
Everyone on the internet pretends to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; some pretend to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; but come of as dumb. I am trying out something different genuine (I would hardly consider this different considering zukerberg did the exact same thing when he wrote a blog and now he is a billionaire sociopath who controls have the world&rsquo;s arse). Blogs have been their till ages and people have been sharing their unfiltered thoughts also since ages. I am just trying to do the same. I am not trying to stand out or create the next viral thread like &ldquo;how to get rich without getting lucky&rdquo;. I am trying to be in those few people who still use the internet to share what they feel and what they think without any expectations.
So if you have reached this point and are disappointed because there was no readers payoff you were expecting, Haha jokes on you fucker.</p>]]></description>
