Since many commercial layers of a data science pipeline are built from statistical foundations (for example, A/B testing), knowing foundational topics of statistics is essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interviewers love to test a candidate&amp;rsquo;s knowledge about the statistic basics, starting with topics like the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers, and then progressing on to the concepts underlying hypothesis-testing, particularly p-values and confidence intervals, as well as Type 1 and Type II error, and their interpretations. All of those topics play an important role in the statistical underpinning of A/B testing. Additionally, derivations and manipulations involving random variables of various probability distributions are also common, particularly in finance interviews. Lastly, a common topic in more technical interviews will involve utilizing MLE and/or MAP.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
