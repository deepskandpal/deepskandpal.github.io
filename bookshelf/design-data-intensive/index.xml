These three words—&lt;strong>Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability&lt;/strong>—are the pillars of any serious system. In a system design interview, these are the top-level concerns you must address. Everything else is an implementation detail that serves these goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are we ultimately trying to achieve here? We&amp;rsquo;re trying to build systems that work, can grow, and don&amp;rsquo;t become a nightmare to manage. Let&amp;rsquo;s break that down.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="1-reliability-it-works-even-when-things-go-wrong">1. Reliability: It Works, Even When Things Go Wrong&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Reliability means the system continues to work correctly, performing its function at the desired level of performance, even in the face of adversity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/design-data-intensive/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 11:18:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/design-data-intensive/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Excellent. Let&amp;rsquo;s move on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve established the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; – we need reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems. Now we get to the first big &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo;: &lt;strong>how do we represent the data?&lt;/strong> This is Chapter 2: &lt;strong>Data Models and Query Languages&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is probably the most important decision you&amp;rsquo;ll make. It profoundly affects not only how you write the software, but how you even &lt;em>think&lt;/em> about the problem you&amp;rsquo;re solving. Get this wrong, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fighting your database for years.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
