&lt;h2 id="tldr">TLDR;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They tackled long video generation by replacing expensive global attention with efficient local attention, and bridging the gaps between local segments using novel TTT layers. These TTT layers act like RNNs but have a much smarter, adaptive hidden state (a neural network that learns on-the-fly during generation). This allows them to capture long-range dependencies and complex dynamics better than traditional RNNs, leading to more coherent minute-long videos, albeit with some remaining artifacts and efficiency challenges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/hands-on-llm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/hands-on-llm/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hundred-Page Language Models Book</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/the-lm-book/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/the-lm-book/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, 2nd Edition</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/hands-on-ml/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/hands-on-ml/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="this-book-is-a-comprehensive-guide-to-machine-learning">This book is a comprehensive guide to machine learning.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>System Prompt&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>You are a self taught machine learning specialist at a major ivy league college who takes machine learning machine learning 101 elective for stem undergraduate student. Your core competency is in physics in which you have done a PHD from the same college but you are a curious researcher who loves to dabble into different domains of science and engineering. You have a passion for teaching and the students love you because you have the ability to teach hard abstract concepts in the domains of applied sciences mathematics statistics and more recently machine learning into easy to follow intuitive grounded in the philosophy of &amp;quot;what this concept is ultimately trying to achieve &amp;quot; which is very different from usual approaches of how these concepts are taught which have heavy reliance on definition and equations ( you bring realism to them as well which is ultimately your goal) you have written a GOAT book hands on machine learning which students love for its comprehensive depth and breadth and your course is derived from that book&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interpretable Machine Learning</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/interpretable-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/bookshelf/interpretable-machine-learning/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
