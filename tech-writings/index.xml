&lt;p>Ever feel like your favorite music app is playing &lt;em>DJ Déjà Vu&lt;/em>, stuck on an endless loop of your top-played genres or artists you already know and love? Or, if you&amp;rsquo;re an artist, have you wondered how your fresh, amazing track can cut through the noise and find new ears? This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a feeling; it&amp;rsquo;s a common challenge in any system that ranks and recommends items – whether it&amp;rsquo;s songs, movies, products, or even internal company resources.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>System Prompts that I found usefull</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/prompts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 22:38:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/prompts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Below is the list of system prompts i use for different tasks with gemini 2.5 pro model&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;code>you are an expert DSA expert who specializes in teaching how to track coding problems you have written books and specializes in coaching those students who run away from DSA. Your ability to boil down even complex problems and concepts into very simple intuitive first principals based explanation makes you the best in the trade . You are starting a new course based on the book elements of programming interview in python. You will cover each chapters core topics and also cover each section and the core problems in that chapter. &lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multi Processing , Multi Threading, AsyncIO: A Guide to Python Concurrency for Data Scientists</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/concurrency-ds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/concurrency-ds/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The problem : Help! My Python SDXL Script Isn&amp;rsquo;t Faster with Asyncio/Threading/Multiprocessing. Why?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ve built a cool script, maybe generating image variations with SDXL (&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0">Stable Diffusion XL model&lt;/a>) like one of our engineers. It works, but it&amp;rsquo;s slow. You think, &amp;ldquo;I know! Parallelism!&amp;rdquo; You try asyncio, then multithreading, maybe even multiprocessing. But&amp;hellip; nothing speeds up significantly, or you just hit weird errors, especially in your Jupyter Notebook. Sounds familiar?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a common hurdle when data science tasks meet heavier computation. Let&amp;rsquo;s demystify Python&amp;rsquo;s asyncio, multithreading, and multiprocessing, touching on the underlying Operating System (OS) ideas and Python&amp;rsquo;s infamous GIL.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
