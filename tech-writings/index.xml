&lt;p>Ever feel like your favorite music app is playing &lt;em>DJ Déjà Vu&lt;/em>, stuck on an endless loop of your top-played genres or artists you already know and love? Or, if you&amp;rsquo;re an artist, have you wondered how your fresh, amazing track can cut through the noise and find new ears? This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a feeling; it&amp;rsquo;s a common challenge in any system that ranks and recommends items – whether it&amp;rsquo;s songs, movies, products, or even internal company resources.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For Behavioural rounds: Loopio</title><link>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/my-work-behavioural-loopio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 19:02:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://deepskandpal.github.io/tech-writings/my-work-behavioural-loopio/</guid><description>&lt;p>For this 45-minute scenario-based round, the key is not just having a story, but having the &lt;em>right&lt;/em> story that is impactful, concise, and perfectly aligned with the value they&amp;rsquo;re probing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is your strategic playbook.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="general-suggestions-for-this-round">General Suggestions for This Round&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s a Conversation, Not an Interrogation:&lt;/strong> Your tone should be collaborative and reflective. You&amp;rsquo;re a senior professional discussing your experiences. Let your passion for solving hard problems come through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The &amp;ldquo;Why This Story&amp;rdquo; Matters:&lt;/strong> For each story, have a clear, one-sentence takeaway in your mind that connects it to the value. E.g., &amp;ldquo;This story shows my grit because I pursued a bug that everyone else had given up on for months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be Concise but Detailed in the &amp;lsquo;Action&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/strong> The Situation and Result should be brief. The Action is where you spend 70% of your time, detailing &lt;em>your&lt;/em> specific thought process and steps.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prepare a Backup:&lt;/strong> Have a second story ready for each value. A common follow-up is, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a great example. Can you tell me about another time when&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Listen to the Question:&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t just jump to your prepared story. Listen to the nuance of their question and slightly tweak your narrative&amp;rsquo;s emphasis to match it perfectly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
