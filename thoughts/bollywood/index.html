I had 2 options one was House full 5 and the other was a few weeks old but new to OTT bhul chuk maaf. Now I personally never found any housefull movie funny not even the first one. Except that one dialogue by Ritesh Deshmukh regarding &ldquo;Biwi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Behen&rdquo; in the first one I have mostly cringed. Pardon me if my sense of humour is not keeping up with the times but I grew up watching comedies of Priya Darshan and Akshay kumar. Raju hirani, and too some extent I find Rohit shetty older films also funny with Chennai Express being my favorite from his Filmography. So I would think of myself as someone who under stands what &ldquo;Brain rot comedy&rdquo; is in Hindi Cinema context. I don&rsquo;t really understand why we have moved on to accept absolutely mediocre films with sub par production/acting/writing/production-design/music/dance in the name of &ldquo;oH bUt iTs tImE pASS dON&rsquo;t tHinK tOO mUch&rdquo; . If i pay money for something I am liable for getting what is expected in return. Let me draw a parallel. If you go to a restaurant to have creamy shahi paneer and the waiter serves you the Now known to everyone &ldquo;Analogue&rdquo; Paneer. Which we all know is not real paneer and also bad for your health but it tastes almost like an original paneer. Would you accept my argument &ldquo;But bro itne paise mai aisa hi paneer milega restaurant ko bhi toh paisa banane hai&rdquo;. Won&rsquo;t you feel cheated that in the name of paneer garbage was fed to you? ( a seemingly paneer looking garbage but still gargbage)</p><p>Same I think is the case with today&rsquo;s hindi films especially in the last few years more specifically post covid. It feels as if they are lost. We do get a gem once in a while but a good hindi movie which entertains you even for time pass is now an exception rather than a norm.</p><p>Why does it sound as if I am pissed well because I am. So pissed that I am trying very hard with each word as I type to not use any abuse ( I abuse a lot IRL but I normally try to keep a calm composure while writing) but its getting harder and harder to keep it at bay since I was trying to watch bhul chuk maaf for 2 reasons.</p><ol><li>I cannot could not bring myself to buy a ticket for HOUSEFULL 5A/B whatever. My wife is a huge housefull fan but even she was not interested in watching the movie after seeing the trailer</li><li>Bhul chuk maaf was available in prime video we were like great we will have a good time plus the expectation is was a bit higher for me since I didn&rsquo;t have any from housefull</li></ol><p>AND OH MY GOD my blood just boiled with each passing frame. I know sounds like an over reaction but its good that we stopped watching after 21 minutes. My wife went to sleep and I switched to Netflix to put on Oppenheimer something which I couldn&rsquo;t get a chance to watch earlier and was looking for an opportunity to catch up. And within 5 min my blood stopped boiling and I was feeling pleasant again.</p><p>Now I know it is NOT AT ALL fair to compare Oppenheimer with any of these movies . And I am not going to . I am not stupid. But while was watching it I realized something really important. Christoper Nolan cares about his movies.</p><p>In Bollywood atleast for now it feels nobody cares anymore.</p><p>Why am I generalizing the whole hindi film industry because its pretty clear that the care factor has gone for a toss at least at the top layer (the yrfs , dharmas, maddocks etc). You pick up randomly any 5 movies from these production houses in the last 5 years and you compare them against any random 5 moves from pre covid era say 2011-2018. And keep a base metric of IMBD ratings and reviews you would see that they have fallen. I have done a very adhoc analysis but If needed I will do a full fledge one to draw some statistically significant conclusions but the high level conclusion is this</p><p>&ldquo;Movies have become expensive over the last 5 years but the quality has declined or has been in decline&rdquo; for the quantification of quality a simple sentiment analysis of the reviews would be easiest way to do it. Now I know its very &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; it feels more like a feeler but this can be a good basis for where to look for directionally to get more data , better methods to prove this. But I think its a waste of time . I don&rsquo;t need to ask a Michelin star chef wether the omelette I am having has too much salt I can eat it and tell it. Similarly we have over complicated movie going experience as well. The film is bad if people who are watching it don&rsquo;t like it , if it doesn&rsquo;t do a good box office, if ( and this is new) no OTT wants it. Its just that simple.</p><p>People just think &ldquo;Oh the film viewing is very subjective look Anupama chopra found befikre nice.&rdquo; well true it can happen but it &ldquo;rarely happens&rdquo; that is the whole point of exceptions. Exceptions show case that there is a general pattern and for that general pattern there are a few Anomalies. So when I feel that hindi cinema is going through a low time I am not just saying after watching ONLY 21 minutes of the latest comedy movie.</p><p>In my specific case I have watched, stree2, singham again, bhool bhulaiya 3, dunki, jawan, pathaan, dhrishyam2, shaitaan , viky vida , fighter, sky force and many many more</p><p>out of this I have only loved dhrishyam2 and some what liked fighter in contrast if i compare them with other movies that i have watched recently like , MI7 , MI8, die hard 3, maharaja ,the menu, Nosferatu, bhramayugam, CRAZZY, american made, KGF Chapter 2 , kantara, Leo, godfather (telegu), the movie that i loved the most was MI7 , American made, maharaja , kantara , KGF Chapter 2 and then i liked Leo, die hard 3, MI8 , and I hated the menu and godfather.</p><p>So clearly for me the hindi cinema has gone down just by this simple comparison. And I am sure a lot us feel the same way.</p><p>At the end of they day what I am trying to say is 2 things</p><ol><li><p>I want my money&rsquo;s worth , If you are comedy movie make me fucking laugh, if you are making an action movie keep me at the edge of the movie. I should be able to pick your films (yes you hindi film directors) over others and yes you have very very tough competition especially in today&rsquo;s world.</p></li><li><p>Do not justify mediocrity do not produce mediocre products and don&rsquo;t give me this bullshit &ldquo;FiLm MakInG iS hARD&rdquo; bitch every job is hard my job is also hard for you ( yes you, you fanatic fans , hindi film apologists), I shouldn&rsquo;t need Data or logic to conclude that shit is bad for you hence you shouldn&rsquo;t eat it. Sometimes its implied.</p></li></ol><p>I just hope that as film fan I continue to find hindi cinema as a viable movie going experience</p></div></article></div></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Deepanshu Kandpal</p></footer></body></html>
