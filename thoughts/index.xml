The latest one being between youtuber mohan mangal and ANI over the use of copyrighted clips. Mohak claims that he has used 5-10 seconds of clips in few of his recent videos from ANI coverage regarding recent events such as operation sindoor in his videos covering the same and ANI has applied copyright strick on his youtube channel because of this. His claim is that when he contacted ANI for the reason and the removal of copyright strike ,He was informed that it will only happen if he pays somewhere in the range of 40-50 lakhs + GST to ANI for the use of those clips in his videos ( they claim they have applied for 8 copyright strikes so there are more to come). Failure to do so will result in getting 3 strikes ( 2 which he has recieved already) that will lead to automatic channel delete as per the YT policy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
