<meta property="og:description" content="Disclaimer: If you don&rsquo;t read more than an insta post or a tweet or a restaurant menu. OR if the last &ldquo;book&rdquo; you owned was that notes on that one chapter you hated in college then this article IS NOT FOR YOU, GO PICK UP A FUCKING BOOK AND READ. THE END. FUCK OFF AND OPEN A BOOK ASSHOLE.
But if you have made it this far that means you read and you are dumb (I know surprising right how can you be well read and still be dumb). So come my child let me ruin your day.
Now before I ruin reading for you let me tell you my self defined, Ignorant and no peer reviewed credentials as an &ldquo;avid reader&rdquo;. Here it is.
Whatever number books you have ever read in your life I have read 10 books more than that (I am 69% sure) And I own a Gold plated 22 volumes world book encyclopedia set (all the way from A to Z take that Amazon 100K $ logo) since the time I could say the word BOOK and they were my only friends for a very long time.I have a maxed-out-on-space kindle, And a book cupboard containing All the hardcovers I have read and completed which is bigger than my current clothes cupboard.
So with this established.Lets just assume I know more about reading than you. You can disagree and I don&rsquo;t care. You are reading and I am writing so shut up and continue reading.
So why is reading bad for you. In one simple sentence. It gives a false sense of accomplishment. It does not apply when we read fiction (if you only read fiction something is wrong with you, I don&rsquo;t know what but you should get yourself checked). It is applicable when you read book for self-improvement of any kind (Again if you ONLY read self help something is wrong with you, I don&rsquo;t know what but you should get yourself checked). It is very safe to assume that something is wrong with me too. Based of what I have written and published till now and this article, If you think I need help or a hug, you are probably right. Only beautiful people who are celebrities are okay in this world. Only people who have families are normal. Those Insta models you jerk off too (yes both of you Guys and Gals) they are happy and normal. Living their life.
Haha if you believe the above line you are fooled my friend. As Will Mcavoy would say in Newsroom &ldquo;There are 2 kinds of people in this world. People who think they are normal. And People who know there is no such thing&rdquo;. We all are bonkers about something or someone. We just are very good at hiding it, from the world from ourselves. Let me repharase in a much simpler way YOU ARE CRAZY, YOU JUST DON&rsquo;T KNOW IT YET. Or maybe you do, in that case. Congratulation. You are one step closer to a happier life.
Haha fooled again. We will cover normal, abnormal later.
Coming to Reading. Again like I mentioned before. I am on a self discovery journey and this notepad you are seeing or reading contains all the garbage I think which I want to throw away. Why not do it privately? because I am not a pussy asshole. I don&rsquo;t mind sharing what I think about this world, with the world. Also If I cannot take criticism on the internet then I don&rsquo;t have balls to be a writer. So I think of it like a practice for the future When I do write on the internet for money. If you found this blog even after me not promoting it. Great you have lot of free time use it. If you want to disagree , Great I am in favour of pluralism. If you want to fight over my views, Great see you in a boxing ring. Also get a life.
The one thing I learned while Reading so much for so many years is. For me it was less about gaining any knowledge and more about escaping reality. Hate your situation. Pick up Harry Potter, you would love the world and will be lost in it. Want to feel like you are doing something about your life. Pick any book in one of those areas where you feel you are lacking:

Weight loss: Don&rsquo;t lose your mind, Lose your weight
Money issues: Psychology of Money
Dating problems: Models, How to attract women through Honesty (If you are a gal reading this then you don&rsquo;t have dating problems, simply be feminine i.e &ldquo;traditonal beauty&rdquo; and submissive in front of the dude you want to fuck and he will leave US presidency for you. Ask Monica lewinsky)
Want to be an entreprenuer: Dream with your eyes open; Steve Jobs ; Shoe Dog
Want to learn new things the new way and stick with it till completion: Ultra-learning
Want to make new habits for a better life: Atomic Habits

These are some of the categories I could think of anyone would be unhappy with in their life. And the books I have suggested are some of the best in the world for the same. So you are welcome.
Have you ever jerked off (yes both of you guy or gal) if you have then you know, How when you complete you are both satisfied and feel guilty. That&rsquo;s what happens when you read too much about a particular topic which you are trying to improve upon.
I call this Knowledge Mastrubation (I did not coin the term.I am borrowing it. I read it in one of the 2 &ldquo;dating playbooks&rdquo; I bought. If this blog goes viral I promise I will mention the creator&rsquo;s name and his gumroad link). Just like mastrubation is not linked with sex. Knowledge Mastrubation is not linked with actual accomplishment. It boils down to theory and practical in the end. This is it this is the point. When you read a book you need to ask yourself a very important question, Why am I reading this? If this question doesn&rsquo;t pop up when you pick up that stack of papers. You are doing a disservice to yourself and you are probably better of not reading that book at all. There are so many Books I started reading and never finished. So many that I got the gist and just stopped midway since I could sense I cannot derive much from it anymore so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to continue.
After years of reading I realized it&rsquo;s better to stop reading if the book is not interesting than to read it till completion. It feels like excessive mastrubation. That OCD of reading the last page when you hate what you are reading will drive you crazy. Sleepless nights and headaches are confirmed. And if you are weak then you might also end up puking. Don&rsquo;t read if you hate it. So you read the kindle sample finished it bought the book on AMAZON and now it doesn&rsquo;t hold up the same attention like that sample did. Cool chuck it its not worth your time, Its okay you wasted your money on it. But if you have netflix and pay for it monthly you already are okay with wasting money. Those 6$ were still well spent on that book. You bought that hard cover after reading the first 2 pages of it from Crossword now the next chapter feels like someone is trying to sexually assault you. Don&rsquo;t worry, try to return the book, if not give it to the rag picker. Or keep it like a trophy to show off. Whatever you do just DON&rsquo;T READ that garbage. Don&rsquo;t put your mind through that torture. It is already tired with all that excessive jerking off. Let me let you in on a industry trade secret. Authors are told by publishers to have &ldquo;killer openings&rdquo; simply for this reason. So that after reading a few pages you buy the book. A book at the end of the day is just like another product. It needs to sell to make money. Next time you feel &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; into buying a book. It&rsquo;s okay you are dumb.It&rsquo;s okay to be dumb sometimes. The system works because of dumb people like you and me.
This is the attention economy now. Who gets the most eye balls makes the most money. The older times when a book was supposed to be the &ldquo;Knowledge of the world&rdquo; is gone. Now every book has to compete with an iPAD with PUBG installed in it. That book is no match to the social media app(whichever you prefer, insta, twitter, snapchat, YT) on your phone. Books don&rsquo;t add value to your life like they used to. Most of it recycled garbage. Unless you are an experienced reader it would be next to impossible for you to differentiate between a good book to a bad one. So stop holding them up on a pedestal. It was written by a human like you and me.
And if you think reading will solve your problems or that its enough. let me tell you nobody got laid by reading pick up lines. Its only when you get a few drinks on your face or being called a creep a few times that you figure out what works. Hence ACTION will aways triump reading. Another secret I would let you in. YOU CAN TAKE ACTION without ANY KNOWLEDGE about that thing you want to improve at all.
Take Action get the ball moving. Then Add reading as a way to accentuate your Actions. That is one of the ways I found some improvement in a few things I am struggling right now.
And not every book deserves your attention. Sometimes a book might look attractive from outside or for a few pages might appear smart and funny. But as you get to know it better you realise what load of crap it is. In that case its ALWAYS better throw it away from your life. Rather than letting it ruin your peace
Throw that book away.
(PS: if you understood the last para you are not dumb you are smart. For rest live in confusion you idiot)" />

Those Insta models you jerk off too (yes both of you Guys and Gals) they are happy and normal. Living their life.</p>
<p>Haha if you believe the above line you are fooled my friend. As Will Mcavoy would say in Newsroom &ldquo;There are 2 kinds of people in this world. People who think they are normal. And People who know there is no such thing&rdquo;. We all are bonkers about something or someone. We just are very good at hiding it, from the world from ourselves. Let me repharase in a much simpler way YOU ARE CRAZY, YOU JUST DON&rsquo;T KNOW IT YET. Or maybe you do, in that case. Congratulation. You are one step closer to a happier life.</p>
<p>Haha fooled again. We will cover normal, abnormal later.</p>
<p>Coming to Reading. Again like I mentioned before. I am on a self discovery journey and this notepad you are seeing or reading contains all the garbage I think which I want to throw away. Why not do it privately? because I am not a pussy asshole. I don&rsquo;t mind sharing what I think about this world, with the world. Also If I cannot take criticism on the internet then I don&rsquo;t have balls to be a writer. So I think of it like a practice for the future When I do write on the internet for money. If you found this blog even after me not promoting it. Great you have lot of free time use it. If you want to disagree , Great I am in favour of pluralism. If you want to fight over my views, Great see you in a boxing ring. Also get a life.</p>
<p>The one thing I learned while Reading so much for so many years is. For me it was less about gaining any knowledge and more about escaping reality. Hate your situation. Pick up Harry Potter, you would love the world and will be lost in it. Want to feel like you are doing something about your life. Pick any book in one of those areas where you feel you are lacking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weight loss: Don&rsquo;t lose your mind, Lose your weight</li>
<li>Money issues: Psychology of Money</li>
<li>Dating problems: Models, How to attract women through Honesty (If you are a gal reading this then you don&rsquo;t have dating problems, simply be feminine i.e &ldquo;traditonal beauty&rdquo; and submissive in front of the dude you want to fuck and he will leave US presidency for you. Ask Monica lewinsky)</li>
<li>Want to be an entreprenuer: Dream with your eyes open; Steve Jobs ; Shoe Dog</li>
<li>Want to learn new things the new way and stick with it till completion: Ultra-learning</li>
<li>Want to make new habits for a better life: Atomic Habits</li>
</ol>
<p>These are some of the categories I could think of anyone would be unhappy with in their life. And the books I have suggested are some of the best in the world for the same. So you are welcome.</p>
<p>Have you ever jerked off (yes both of you guy or gal) if you have then you know, How when you complete you are both satisfied and feel guilty. That&rsquo;s what happens when you read too much about a particular topic which you are trying to improve upon.</p>
<p>I call this Knowledge Mastrubation (I did not coin the term.I am borrowing it. I read it in one of the 2 &ldquo;dating playbooks&rdquo; I bought. If this blog goes viral I promise I will mention the creator&rsquo;s name and his gumroad link). Just like mastrubation is not linked with sex. Knowledge Mastrubation is not linked with actual accomplishment. It boils down to theory and practical in the end. This is it this is the point. When you read a book you need to ask yourself a very important question, Why am I reading this? If this question doesn&rsquo;t pop up when you pick up that stack of papers. You are doing a disservice to yourself and you are probably better of not reading that book at all. There are so many Books I started reading and never finished. So many that I got the gist and just stopped midway since I could sense I cannot derive much from it anymore so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to continue.</p>
<p>After years of reading I realized it&rsquo;s better to stop reading if the book is not interesting than to read it till completion. It feels like excessive mastrubation. That OCD of reading the last page when you hate what you are reading will drive you crazy. Sleepless nights and headaches are confirmed. And if you are weak then you might also end up puking. Don&rsquo;t read if you hate it. So you read the kindle sample finished it bought the book on AMAZON and now it doesn&rsquo;t hold up the same attention like that sample did. Cool chuck it its not worth your time, Its okay you wasted your money on it. But if you have netflix and pay for it monthly you already are okay with wasting money. Those 6$ were still well spent on that book. You bought that hard cover after reading the first 2 pages of it from Crossword now the next chapter feels like someone is trying to sexually assault you. Don&rsquo;t worry, try to return the book, if not give it to the rag picker. Or keep it like a trophy to show off. Whatever you do just DON&rsquo;T READ that garbage. Don&rsquo;t put your mind through that torture. It is already tired with all that excessive jerking off. Let me let you in on a industry trade secret. Authors are told by publishers to have &ldquo;killer openings&rdquo; simply for this reason. So that after reading a few pages you buy the book. A book at the end of the day is just like another product. It needs to sell to make money. Next time you feel &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; into buying a book. It&rsquo;s okay you are dumb.It&rsquo;s okay to be dumb sometimes. The system works because of dumb people like you and me.</p>
<p>This is the attention economy now. Who gets the most eye balls makes the most money. The older times when a book was supposed to be the &ldquo;Knowledge of the world&rdquo; is gone. Now every book has to compete with an iPAD with PUBG installed in it. That book is no match to the social media app(whichever you prefer, insta, twitter, snapchat, YT) on your phone. Books don&rsquo;t add value to your life like they used to. Most of it recycled garbage. Unless you are an experienced reader it would be next to impossible for you to differentiate between a good book to a bad one. So stop holding them up on a pedestal. It was written by a human like you and me.</p>
<p>And if you think reading will solve your problems or that its enough. let me tell you nobody got laid by reading pick up lines. Its only when you get a few drinks on your face or being called a creep a few times that you figure out what works. Hence ACTION will aways triump reading. Another secret I would let you in. YOU CAN TAKE ACTION without ANY KNOWLEDGE about that thing you want to improve at all.</p>
<p>Take Action get the ball moving. Then Add reading as a way to accentuate your Actions. That is one of the ways I found some improvement in a few things I am struggling right now.</p>
<p>And not every book deserves your attention. Sometimes a book might look attractive from outside or for a few pages might appear smart and funny. But as you get to know it better you realise what load of crap it is. In that case its ALWAYS better throw it away from your life. Rather than letting it ruin your peace</p>
<p>Throw that book away.</p>
<p>(PS: if you understood the last para you are not dumb you are smart. For rest live in confusion you idiot)</p></div><footer>
