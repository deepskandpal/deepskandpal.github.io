                    </div><p>I always feel everyone has a particular taste for something and a review of anything should help the person reading it judge whether that particular thing is for them or not.</p>
<p>often times you do come across something which completely changes you and pushes you in a different direction. The right direction. For some people its films for others it could be music, painting or a great Ted talk.</p>
<p>And for some its books.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about one of those kind of books. The one that probably has the potential to change your life</p>
<p><strong>Show your work</strong> by author <a href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Austin kelon</a> is a 116 pages Illustrated book containing the tips and reasons of putting your work online for the world to consume. But its not your typical wiki how of how to start a blog or a youtube channel. It answers or rather helps you answer <em>why</em> you should put your work out there in the first place. As the author of the famous book <em>start with why</em> , Simon Sinek would put it &ldquo;start with <em>why you want to do it</em> , rest everything will fall in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Austin manages through this book is even better . He makes a case for <em>why you <strong>should</strong> do it</em>. Anyone who has have had trouble starting out and if part of the hesitation is any kind of a mental barrier they should pick up a copy of this book.</p>
<p>What Austin has is what a lot of today&rsquo;s digital age writers possess; to convey a lot with few words. This Loss-less data compression benefits anyone who has aversion for large written text. The illustrations are an added bonus. What helps is Austin has a habit to pull examples for a wide array of sources to make a case for a particular point. for example to make a point regarding how important is being an amatuer at something in this day and age he takes the example of Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke; quoting his response “That I don’t know what I’m doing.”, when asked about what he thought his greatest strength was; from an interview which yorke gave some time ago. There are other examples as well the one which struck me out the most was about the film critic Tommy Edison who is blind by birth!. What context is his story used for, for that you will have to read the book</p>
<p>Where Austin wins, I believe is when he is able to distingush between self promotion and personal branding for work and explains the differene between the two. I personally have struggled with this for a long time. This was one of the mental blockers for me to write anything on the internet. And the fact that you are reading this article on my blog should tell you the affect his arguments for personal branding have had on me. It is because of this reason I chose to write my first book review ever for this book!</p>
<p>The point Austin emphasizes a lot is the <em>need</em> to be a part of the internet, to truly be a global person, to own a piece of real estate on the internet, to carve out a place for your thoughts and work and how to create your own scenius. Read the book to understand what that word means. He doesn&rsquo;t explain from the point of view <em><strong>if</strong></em> should you start putting something out on the internet or not but rather <em><strong>when</strong></em> should you be doing it and <em><strong>what</strong></em> you should be sharing.</p>
<p>Throughout your reading you will come across some excellent pieces of advice which will stay with you, for example</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The idea of <em>you don&rsquo;t have to be a genius</em> or the point <em>“The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act,”</em> are some of the gems which are peppered all over the book for you to discover.</p>
<p>This is the book for anyone and everyone who truly wants to create a personal brand for themselves. It is for someone who wants to leverage the power of the internet for personal growth. To meet interesting people, To find groups who share similar interests as their&rsquo;s. To be truly part of this global community, while side stepping any kind of indulgence into metaphorical voyeurism.</p>
<p>If you want to do any of the above. This book is for you</p>
<p>And as for any critisim. I think at this point it will just be nitpicking. I do believe that instead of a book this could have easily been a series of blog posts. As it does feel like a collection of articles put together. But I get the decision of turning it in a book. as the famous line of the Joker from the movie The Dark Knight explains <em>If you are good at something never do it for free</em>.</p>
<p>Finally I would leave you with the last advice from this book for you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work.</strong></em></p></div><footer>
