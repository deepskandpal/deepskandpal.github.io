The car zooms past the camera
&ldquo;I have never driven anything like this before&rdquo; Clarkson screamed, to overpower the noise coming from the 600 bhp engine of the Koenigsegg. The BBC top gear anchor, not known to mince his words said what he felt, 
absolute awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the thing is though the Ferrari&rsquo;s are built with a zest and a Latin passion. This is build in a more northern European way&rdquo;
A sharp turn approaches, Jeremy Clarkson shifts down the gear, a bit of understeer, and the makes it through the corners . &ldquo;everything feels solid, the levers, the clutch, the steering, you could drive this car to the gym, hit the road afterward, a little bit of turn here, a little bit of turn there, hit the highway and you would have done more workout than you would have at the gym&rdquo;</p>
<p>From inside the car, it felt like any other top gear supercar reviews. From the outside, it looked as if a child has been let loose with their favorite toy</p>
<p>A very expensive toy</p>
<p>&ldquo;now Koenigsegg, claims that this car can go from 0–60 miles an hour in under 3 seconds with a top speed of 245 miles per hour, if those numbers are correct then this is possibly the fastest road car in the world.&rdquo; The top gear race track was not long enough to test the top speed, the fastest they had ever done till then was 170 mph (273.588 Kmph)in a Pagani Zonda, So Jeremy decided to go after Zonda&rsquo;s record. &ldquo;Now there is one problem, the runway is so wide that you lose perspective, you think a little bit further, a little bit more and before you know you end up only 40 inches from the end of the runway and in big trouble&rdquo;. 
A big Brake sign is put at a safe distance for Clarkson to know when he needs to hit the breaks. &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do this&rdquo; he revs the engine, the supercharged V8 starts to roar. and with a screechy burnout, the Koenigsegg launches itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ok here we go, (shifts up, as the rev&rsquo;s sound starts to increase), that G force is hurting my neck, (shifts another gear), I am going to take as much speed as I can from this bottom corner before I go on to the main straight.&rdquo; </p>
<p>he builds up the speed and then…
3, 2, 1</p>
<p>&ldquo;at 112 kmph flat! the supercharger wacking the fuel in&rdquo; Jeremy screams as he shifts the gear up the engine is pumping those bhp at a defeaning sound now &ldquo;into third (shifts up) up to 7000 rpm and we are not even in the fourth yet…205 kmph into 4th and now we are going into 5th &quot; the steering starts to fumble in his hands</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting a little bumpy here, and there we go 258.. into the 6th, 260, 271, 277, Brake hard !!, hard&rdquo; as he just crosses the brake sign  he starts to apply those magnesium alloy break to those carbon fiber wheels</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woah, Now we got a little button here that tells us how fast that was&rdquo; Clarkson presses the button the display meter shows
280 kmph</p>
<p>&ldquo;oh ho ah, two hundred and eighty kilometers an hour that a hundred and seventy-four miles an hour, four miles an hour more than I managed in the zonda, So welcome everyone to the fastest car we have ever tested&rdquo;
That was in the year 2008. Koenigsegg would go on to break more records on almost every aspect a hypercar is judged, performance, aesthetics, design, innovation, and of course. speed. It was also the first production car that they ever built with the intent to sell. In fact couple of months before that top gear review that very same car had broken the record of being the fastest street-legal car on the planet by beating the record of Maclaren F1 which held the record previously.
It is almost astonishing that in 16 years they have managed to go from a small squeaky startup in a small town outside Sweden to defeating an industry giant in their own game.</p>
<p>if you are not a petrol head (a fancy term for car nerds)you are probably not aware of the iconic BBC show top gear and its outspoken, witty host Jeremy Clarkson who is not easily impressionable even by some of the most exotic cars in the world, but on that day he seemed genuinely happy.</p>
<p>sure being the fastest car on a TV show track doesn&rsquo;t mean much and indeed the Koenigsegg record didn&rsquo;t mean much, since it was beaten by Bugatti a couple of months later
Bugatti would go on to become the fastest road car in the world, time and again only to be beaten intermittently once or twice by Koenigsegg. Buggati using its decades of expertise in designing high-performance supercars along with years of professional racing experience surely deserves to be number 1.</p>
<p>But it has always been kept on its toes by this small, unorthodox Swedish hypercar manufacturer. Not only Buggati, it took a while but Koenigsegg has gathered respect among the likes of Ferraris and Lamborghinis and McLarens all the veterans in the hypercar manufacturing game. for a company that was less than 2 decades old, it was a huge accomplishment to be considered equals among its peers.</p>
<p>The journey wasn&rsquo;t easy and as we will see shortly in more than one occasion it felt as if it was the end of the company. But thanks to its resilient founder Christian von Koenigsegg thankfully it didn&rsquo;t.
Koenigsegg has time and again redefined as to what passes for a hypercar.
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a car its automotive artistry on wheels, there is nothing like this on the road.&rdquo; as Christian would put it.</p>
<p>Indeed anyone who has seen an Agera 2010 would have set the same thing, while art is something subjective to each individual&rsquo;s taste there was one thing everybody would agree on:
There was nothing like this on the road</p>
<h3 id="the-bicycleman" class="headerLink"><a href="#the-bicycleman" class="header-mark"></a>The Bicycle Man</h3><p>If he can do it so can I
It all started back in 1977. As a family tradition, the Koenigsegg family would go every weekend to the open theatre to see the movie that would be playing. Most of the films were local house productions made with a limited budget. Christian was 5 years old. The film that was on, that weekend was the bicycle Man. The swedes are mostly known for their entrepreneurial jest. So most of these films have similar themes about ordinary people making realize of their outlandish dreams. And this film was no different. </p>
<p>It was about a bicycle repairman realizing that he wants to build himself a race car after seeing one during a seasonal race. Against all odds, he finally achieves his dream. For the adults of the Koenigsegg family, it was a good entertainer. For Christian, it was a life-altering moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it was at that point I knew, exactly what I wanted to do&rdquo;, Christian said Recounting the incident years later &ldquo;I wanted to make cars, just like that repairman, and if he can do it so can I&rdquo;
His household came from an entrepreneurial background. Starting a business rather than finding a job was encouraged. So he was covered on that front. The problem was he didn&rsquo;t have any background in either racing or engineering.</p>
<p>At school, he was the smartest kid, and keeping in line with his dream of building cars started showing engineering aptitude. by the time he hit his teens, he was already known as the best moped turner around the town.</p>
<p>But starting a company requires huge capital especially when the company builds a hypercar. Resources were scarce but it didn&rsquo;t deter him from at least master the engineering department. &ldquo;I always figured the money would come, I need to figure out how to make a car once I have money.&rdquo;
In order to raise some capital, he decided to start a trading company when he was 19 years old &ldquo;I traded in anything and everything I could get my hands on&rdquo; Christian remarked &ldquo;if I could buy something for X amount of money, rebrand or package it and sell it for some more money I realized I could make some money there which would ultimately fund my dream&rdquo; </p>
<p>He traded in live stocks, old items, used items. Literally anything. To understand the car business a little bit closely he decided to get a real job at a Suzuki dealership just outside Stockholm. It taught him a lot about selling cars but not about the cars he wanted to sell.
At the time he started dating a girl who would, later on, become his wife. </p>
