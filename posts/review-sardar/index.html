                    </div><p>I have a special place for creators who try something unique. As a review this arcticle is to judge a product based on the end result rather than the intentions with which the product might have been made in the first place. That is the objective of all reviews. I would like to break that rule today. For I believe that sardar ka grandson should be judged with what was the intention of the filmmakers rather than what the end result was.</p>
<p>I would explain my reasoning in a bit but first lets get the technicalities of a film review completed. Lets talk about the story.</p>
<p>The story revolves around a 90 year old grand mother Sardar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neena_Gupta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Neena Gupta</a> who&rsquo;s last wish is to visit her ancestral home in Lahore pakistan. When due to some complicated reasons (read: lame) her visa is not approved. Her Grandson Amreek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Kapoor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Arjun Kapoor</a> takes it upon himself to do the insane. <em>Get the house from Lahore, to Amritsar</em> , yup that&rsquo;s right. Move the <em>entire</em> building from its foundation from one country to another country. What happens next is something you would have to watch the film to know more.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it obvious? Like we have grown on Bollywood, How can it <em>not</em> have an happy ending.</p>
<p>Moving on, to the cast and crew. Well there are no surprises here. Every actor has played their parts just like they have played all their roles. Neena Gupta, just like always is awesome. Arjun Kapoor is still disappointing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumud_Mishra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">kumud mishra</a> can play any character no matter how shallow the writing, and sell it to the audience like a boss, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakul_Preet_Singh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Rakul Preet</a> once again fails to make a mark.</p>
<p>Coming to screenplay, Direction and diagloues. Its nothing out of ordinary. The beats are similar to any wacky comedy set that is set in a small town , lead by ayushman khurrana. For a first time director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5548130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Kaashvi Nair</a> Does a commendable job, to bring the movie in the zone of slice of life comedies with emphasis on human relationships, the genre most hindi films fall under. The dialogues except what are given to Sardar are mediocre with at some places even bordering towards cringy. And the screen play as mentioned before is predictable, if you have seen the trailer, you already know how the film is going to end.</p>
<p>So far except the opening paragraph there is nothing positive I have written yet about the film. And If I stop my review here then, you would probably get the impression that I am asking you to skip this one. But if you have made it so far, I would suggest you stay for some more time. And then decide at the end, Whether you would want to watch this film or not.</p>
<p>So its obvious, the film fails to make a mark in the technicalities of filmmaking, at least from a <em>film review</em> point of you. But despite all its cons I would like to highlight the plot once again</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>The story revolves around a 90 year old grand mother Sardar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neena_Gupta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Neena Gupta</a> who&rsquo;s last wish is to visit her ancestral home in Lahore pakistan. When due to some complicated reasons (read: lame) her visa is not approved. Her Grandson Amreek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Kapoor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Arjun Kapoor</a> takes it upon himself to do the insane. <em>Get the house from Lahore, to Amritsar</em> , yup that&rsquo;s right. Move the <em>entire</em> building from its foundation from one country to another country</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where have you heard this concept before? Is it a remake? which industry or a beloved foreign film are we ruining now?</p>
<p>With these questions I searched the internet, to find its origins, because  it felt too good to be true of a concept, this original, to be green lit by a studio and then made into a film with commercial actors. And that&rsquo;s where this film wins me. I know its quite a low bar when, just because of the intention of what the film was trying to be we should say praises for it. And it would be right to point out that if this film gets a pass based on that, then why not do it for every product. But I&rsquo;m not generalizing here as a lot of factors go into a product creation, including the external factors like the industry it is set in. Bollywood for the most part is a risk-averse industry. Keep in mind I&rsquo;m not talking about Indian Cinema, which encompasses, Extraordinary film industries like the telegu film industry or the tamil film industry. Which are known to push the boundaries of Indian cinema. I&rsquo;m talking specifically about the hindi film industry AKA Bollywood. And for most of us that is the primary source for our film appetite.</p>
<p>And As a fan of bollywood and storytelling it aches me for the most part when we see formulaic, rinse-and-repeat films ; side note: other film industries including hollywood are also guilty of telling formulaic stories, but they offset this, by greenlighting extraordinary films with original concepts each year; Unfortunately this phenomenon is less observed in Bollywood specifically. And Although I&rsquo;m not a trade analyst, but I guess it has something to do with the performance of a film on the box office.</p>
<p>Which Why even original concepts gets lathed with shitty, formulaic execution even though on paper it felt compelling.(the other example which comes to mind is the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baar_Baar_Dekho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Baar Baar Dekho</a>). So When creators try something different, one of the 2 things happen. Either it is remarkable but too far out for anyone to appreciate its brilliance as it does not fall under the general diaspora of hindi film making (eg : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laal_Kaptaan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Laal Kaptaan</a>), or the creators, not wanting to loose money polish it out according to their understanding of the film industry business and make sardaar ka grandson.</p>
<p>Either way, its the audience which looses. How you ask, because when a laal kaptaan is a failure, this already risk-averse industry becomes even more stingy when it comes to green lighting any original concept, and when a sardar ka grandson is a failure, they double back and stop producing any film with original concept all together. They go back to what worked in the past and do the exact same thing to recreate that success. That&rsquo;s how we end up with films like <em>Radhe</em></p>
<p>But the landscape is finally changing. With the advent of all these OTT platforms, films are not subject to just box office now to prove whether they were successful or not. New metrics have come up to measure a films success. Creators are given more autonomy in choosing the subjects they want to tell stories about. And hopefully this will show us the Bollywood which we may have not seen before.</p>
<p>So in short. Go watch sardar ka grandson, yes Arjun kapoor is unbearable. And that&rsquo;s unfortunate. But its definitely not a bad film which is unwatchable, its a good family entertainers. Which has tried something new.</p></div><footer>
